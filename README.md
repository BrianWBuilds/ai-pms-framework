**AI-PMS** is a structured framework designed to help project managers deliver AI and machine learning initiatives effectively and responsibly.

It bridges traditional PM methods with the unique challenges of AI, including data uncertainty, model iteration, ethical risk, and cross-functional misalignment.

### Why AI-PMS?

- PMBOK and Agile are not designed for AI’s non-determinism
- AI initiatives often fail due to poor structure, not poor models
- AI-PMS enables clarity, accountability, and ethical oversight from day one

### Core Phases

1. **Initiate** – Feasibility, data audit, stakeholder alignment  
2. **Plan** – Metrics, risks, adaptive timelines  
3. **Build** – Pipeline, experiments, reproducibility  
4. **Validate** – Accuracy, fairness, explainability  
5. **Deploy** – Monitoring, rollback plans, integration  
6. **Maintain** – Retraining, governance, failure tracking
